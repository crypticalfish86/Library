# Hello And Welcome!
This was one of my first year projects to simulate a library of books on shelves It was made entirely from scratch by me using a prewritten specification given by the lecturers

The repository should contain the following classes:  
Book - a placeholder for a book containing all attributes required to allocate a book in a library  
ShelfSpace - a place to store a single book in (Is a doubly linked list with references to other shelfspaces to its left and right)  
Shelf - an entire shelf to store shelfSpace (has a reference to the left and right end of the shelfspace)  
Library - Several array lists categorising all books by searching the shelves  

Thankyou for visiting my github!
